      SYNOPSIS:

	SNPsplit is designed to read in alignment files in SAM/BAM format and determine the allelic origin of reads
	that cover known SNP positions. For this to work the alignment step must have been carried out against a
	genome that had all SNP positions replaced by Ns, and a list of SNP positions between the two different genomes
	has to be provided using the option --snp_file.

	SNPsplit operates in two stages:

	I) SNPsplit-tag: SNPsplit analyses reads (single-end mode) or read pairs (paired-end mode) for overlaps
        with known SNP positions, and writes out a tagged BAM file in the same order as the original file.

        II) SNPsplit-sort: the tagged BAM file is read in and is being sorted into allele-specific files. This process
        may also be run as a stand-alone module (tag2sort).


        The SNPsplit-tag module determines whether a read can be assigned to a certain allele and appends an additional
        optional field 'XX:Z:' to each read. The tag can be one of the following:

        XX:Z:UA - Unassigned
        XX:Z:G1 - Genome 1-specific
        XX:Z:G2 - Genome 2-specific
        XX:Z:CF - Conflicting


        The SNPsplit-sort module reads in the tagged BAM file and sorts the reads (or read pairs) according to their XX:Z:
        tag (or the combination of tags for paired-end or Hi-C reads) into subfiles.


      USAGE:      SNPsplit  [options] --snp_file <SNP.file.gz> [input file(s)]


    input file(s)          Mapping output file in SAM or BAM format. SAM files (ending in .sam) will first be
    converted to BAM using Samtools.

    --snp_file <file>      Mandatory file specifying SNP positions to be considered; may be a plain text file or
                           gzip compressed. Currently, the SNP file is expected to be in the following format:

                                       SNP-ID     Chromosome  Position    Strand   Ref/SNP
                           example:   33941939        9       68878541       1       T/G

                           Only the information contained in fields 'Chromosome', 'Position' and 'Reference/SNP base'
                           are being used for analysis. The genome referred to as 'Ref' will be used as genome 1,
                           the genome containing the 'SNP' base as genome 2.

	--single_end           Manually sets data to single-end. Skips AUTO-DETECT.

    --paired               Paired-end mode. (Default: AUTO-DETECT).

    -o/--outdir <dir>      Write all output files into this directory. By default the output files will be written into
                           the same folder as the input file(s). If the specified folder does not exist, SNPsplit will attempt
                           to create it first. The path to the output folder can be either relative or absolute.

    --singletons           If the allele-tagged paired-end file also contains singleton alignments (which is the
                           default for e.g. TopHat), these will be written out to extra files (ending in _st.bam)
                           instead of writing everything to combined paired-end and singleton files. Default: OFF.

    --no_sort              This option skips the sorting step if BAM files are already sorted by read name (e.g.
                           Hi-C files generated by HiCUP). Please note that setting --no_sort for unsorted paired-end
                           files will break the tagging process!

    --hic                  Assumes Hi-C data processed with HiCUP (www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/)
                           as input, i.e. the input BAM file is paired-end and Reads 1 and 2 follow each other. Thus,
                           this option also sets the flags --paired and --no_sort. Default: OFF.

    --bisulfite            Assumes Bisulfite-Seq data processed with Bismark (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark)
                           as input. In paired-end mode (--paired), Read 1 and Read 2 of a pair are expected to follow
                           each other in consecutive lines. SNPsplit will run a quick check at the start of a run to see if the
                           file provided appears to be a Bismark file, and set the flags --bisulfite and/or --paired
                           automatically. In addition it will perform a quick check to see if a paired-end file appears
                           to have been positionally sorted, and if not will set the --no_sort flag.

    --samtools_path        The path to your Samtools installation, e.g. /home/user/samtools/. Does not need to
                           be specified explicitly if Samtools is in the PATH already.

    --verbose              Verbose output (for debugging).




    SNPsplit-sort specific options (tag2sort):
    ==========================================

    --conflicting/--weird  Reads or read pairs that were classified as 'Conflicting' (XX:Z:CF) will be written to
                           an extra file (ending in .conflicting.bam) instead of being simply skipped. Reads may be
                           classified as 'Conflicting' if a single read contains SNP information for both genomes at
                           the same time, or if the SNP position was deleted from the read. Read-pairs are considered
                           'Conflicting' if either read is was tagged with the XX:Z:CF flag. Default: OFF.

    --sam                  The output will be written out in SAM format instead of BAM (default). SNPsplit will attempt to use
                           the path to Samtools that was specified with --samtools_path, or, if it hasn't been
                           specified, attempt to find Samtools in the PATH environment. If no installation of
                           Samtools can be found, the SAM output will be compressed with GZIP instead (yielding a
                           .sam.gz output file).

	--skip_tag2sort        Carry out the allele-tagging process, and exit afterwards. This might be desirable when using SNPsplit in
	                       pipelining systems, such as Nextflow, when a deduplication step is to be added following allele tagging.

    --help                 Displays this help information and exits.

    --version              Displays version information and exits.
